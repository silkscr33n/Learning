Knowledge Check

1. From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?

	Content, padding, boarder, margin

2. What does the box-sizing CSS property do?

	The box-sizing  property allows you to set the dimensions of the content box or the border that the content sits in.

3. What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
	
	The Standard box model focuses on the dimensions of the content area; the alternate box model focuses on the dimensions of the boarder the that content sits inside of, allowing the result of the code to represent the space between one box and its content and another.

4. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?

	ideally, margin would be my first guess, however if used together, one can specify in greater detail the exact about between content.

5. Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?

	padding, as this specifies the distance between content and its border.

6. Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?

	margin, since box models collapsed on each other, using a negative integer to represent the amount of space you wish to have content overlap each other.
